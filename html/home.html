    <p>My research focuses on how Greek and Roman authors understood language differences 
        between various groups in the ancient Mediterranean and how this understanding 
        relates to their ideas about ethnicity and identity. I work in particular upon 
        Herodotus, the subject of my dissertation, using methodologies from philology, literary analysis, 
        and (socio)linguistics. My dissertation examines Herodotusâ€™ representation and understanding of 
        languages, including but not limited to Greek itself.
